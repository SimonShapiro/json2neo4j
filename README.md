json2neo4j
==========

A node.js based route to neo4j providing a REST interface that persists json documents as a group of neo4j nodes and relationships

## Background

While neo4j has support for json, it is restricted to simple key:value pairs of string, number and arrays of string or number.
nodejs acts as a front-end to neo4j to present a RESTful interface to neo4j.
By POSTing a json string to the node.js route, the json structure is represented in neo4j as a group of nodes and relationships.
GETting this group re-creates the original json.

## Example

The following json file,

```
test = {
    "name":"simon",
    "age": 104,
    "address":{ "pcode":"bee",
      "address_lines":["one","two",{"x":'X',"y":23,"z":"zed"}]
    },
    "telephones":["01234-","09877-"]
}
```

is created in neo4j as the network set out below:
